# Beacons Page Link Checker

## Purpose

Check for broken links on your Beacons profile page

## Current State

It only works in Node with npm run start. Opens Chromium browser and returns links in terminal.

## To-Dos

- Move scraping (index.js, pageController.js, pageScraper.js and browser.js) to /api (serverless)
- Create front-end: user enters Beacons username and it returns link statuses
