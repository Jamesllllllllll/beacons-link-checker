# Beacons Page Link Checker

## Purpose

Check for broken links on your Beacons profile page

## Current State

- **Main** branch fetches and displays a user's page links in Node
- **Development** branch is moving the functions to /api to be accessed via the front-end UI (in progress)

## To-Dos

- Move scraping (index.js, pageController.js, pageScraper.js and browser.js) to /api (serverless)
- Create front-end: user enters Beacons username and it returns link statuses
